## The `poseidon2` command line software

To automate the most important operations with Poseidon v.2 packages, the department collaboratively develops a bash command line tool called poseidon2. See the help module to learn about the current set of features: `./poseidon2.sh help`.

If you want to add features please contact @nevrome to get write access to the source code.
